# Pixel-Art-Maker
Project in Udacity Front-End Developer Nanodegree Program
## Project Details
In this project, a [starter template](https://github.com/udacity/project-pixel-art-maker-starter) with preformatted HTML and CSS was provided and instructions to build the JS to build and color a grid. 
## This version 

1. Sumitting the form builds a grid, made of a `table`, to the width and length dimensions specified.
2. Resetting the form clears the grid, resets the length and width dimensions to their minimum value, and clears any color input that may be entered.
3. To provide a list of available colors, the pick a color section is accompanied by a link to named web colors on Wikipedia.
4. When a color is specified, clicking a cell colors the grid the corresponding color.
    1. If the cell is already colored, clicking the cell will clerar the color.
5. Clicking the clean button clears the colors from the grid.
